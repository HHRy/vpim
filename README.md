See The File `OLD_README` for the proper documentation for this lovely
Gem.

My Fork does whatever it takes to make this gem work with Ruby 1.9 __and__
correctly handle the multitude of different character encoding issues you're
going to encounter if you ever use this in production.

This means it's totally and utterly broken for Ruby < 1.9.2 and that's the point
really.

When I get time, I'll fix the tests too, since at the time of forking they don't
even bloody run.
